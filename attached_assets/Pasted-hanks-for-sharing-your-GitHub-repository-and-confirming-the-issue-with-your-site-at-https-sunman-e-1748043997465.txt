hanks for sharing your GitHub repository and confirming the issue with your site at https://sunman.energy. Let's work through a comprehensive checklist to identify and resolve the problem.

✅ 1. Verify GitHub Pages Configuration
Repository Settings:

Navigate to your GitHub repository: https://github.com/athletefi1/SolarHero.

Click on Settings > Pages.

Ensure that:

Source is set to the correct branch (e.g., main) and folder (/ (root)).

The Custom domain is set to sunman.energy.

Enforce HTTPS is checked.

CNAME File:

Confirm that there's a CNAME file in the root of your repository containing only:

Copy
Edit
sunman.energy
✅ 2. Check File Structure and Paths
Root Directory:

Ensure that index.html, style.css, script.js, and any other assets are located in the root directory of your repository.

Relative Paths:

Open index.html and verify that all linked resources use relative paths. For example:

html
Copy
Edit
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./style.css">
<script src="./script.js" defer></script>
Avoid using absolute paths like /style.css or /script.js, as they can cause issues on GitHub Pages.

✅ 3. Inspect Browser Console for Errors
Open Developer Tools:

In your browser, press F12 or right-click and select Inspect to open Developer Tools.

Console Tab:

Navigate to the Console tab.

Look for any error messages, such as:

404 Not Found errors for missing resources.

JavaScript errors indicating issues in your scripts.

Network Tab:

Check the Network tab to see if all resources are loading correctly.

Pay attention to any failed requests or resources that are not loading.

✅ 4. Confirm DNS Settings on Namecheap
A Records:

Log in to your Namecheap account.

Navigate to Domain List > Manage for sunman.energy.

Under the Advanced DNS tab, ensure the following A records are present:

Type	Host	Value
A	@	185.199.108.153
A	@	185.199.109.153
A	@	185.199.110.153
A	@	185.199.111.153

CNAME Record:

Also, ensure there's a CNAME record:

Type	Host	Value
CNAME	www	athletefi1.github.io

This ensures that www.sunman.energy redirects correctly.

✅ 5. Clear Browser Cache
Sometimes, browsers cache old versions of your site. To ensure you're viewing the latest version:

Hard Refresh:

Press Ctrl + F5 (Windows/Linux) or Cmd + Shift + R (Mac) to perform a hard refresh.

Clear Cache:

Go to your browser settings and clear the cache for sunman.energy.

✅ 6. Additional Considerations
Case Sensitivity:

Ensure that file names and paths match exactly, considering case sensitivity. For example, Style.css and style.css are different.

File Extensions:

Confirm that all files have the correct extensions (.html, .css, .js) and are not accidentally saved with incorrect ones.

✅ 7. Test GitHub Pages Default URL
Before relying solely on your custom domain, test the default GitHub Pages URL:

Visit: https://athletefi1.github.io/SolarHero/

If the site loads correctly here, the issue may be with your custom domain configuration.

By following this checklist, you should be able to identify and resolve the issue causing your site to display a blank page. If you continue to experience problems, please provide any error messages from the browser console or additional details, and I'll be glad to assist further.
